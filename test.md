### Validate the structured data

To verify that your structured data is correct, many platforms provide validation tools.

1.  In a new browser window, open the [Google Structured Data Validation Tool](https://developers.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/).
2.  Select the **Code Snippet** tab.
3.  Copy and paste the full source code from your AMP page into the text editor panel of the validation tool.
4.  Click **Run Test**.

If your structured data is valid, you should see **0 errors**, and **0 warnings**.
